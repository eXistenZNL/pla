{"name":"Pla","tagline":"Like Make, but with a yaml file","body":"# Pla\r\n\r\nPla helps you automate workflows in a very simple way. Much like make, but with a yaml file structure.\r\n\r\n## Start working with Pla\r\n\r\nWith Pla you define the targets in a Yaml file called `Plafile.yml`\r\nand run the targets from the command line.\r\n\r\nLets say we use Pla to kickstart our working day. We will make a Plafile which starts our local dev server, starts our IDE\r\n and opens the application we're working on in the browser.\r\n \r\nFirst create the Plafile with a target called `dev`:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# Plafile.yml\r\ndev:\r\n  - docker-compose up -d\r\n  - pstorm .\r\n  - open http://local.project.url/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen simply run Pla from the command line:\r\n```bash\r\n$ pla dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nPla will then run the shell commands you specified in the Plafile.\r\n\r\n## How to install Pla\r\n\r\nUse the pip installer to install Pla\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n$ pip install pla\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ pla [target]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you do not provide a target, the default target called `all` will run.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\n- [Richard Tuin](https://github.com/rtuin)\r\n- [All Contributors](../../contributors)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT).
